            <li>1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste</li>

            <li>Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. </li>

            <li>Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties.
            <li> Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes.</li>
